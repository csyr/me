## Self-evaluation

I worked at Tencent (T3-1) and Baidu (T7) in the past years. 

At the same time, I have abundant entrepreneurial experience for 5 years in the field of e-commerce and social platforms and so on. I have 6 years experience of back-end system construction, owing 7 years development experience of PHP and GO. 

In team management, I have more than 10 years of technical team management experience, including 3 years of large technical team management with about 120+ technical staff.
As a technical leader, I can evaluate  technical proposals comprehensively according to the requirement of project products and propose a scalable and reusable scheme.And I can pre-evaluate potential technical risks and give corresponding optimized technical solutions. 

I am proficient at NGINX, PHP, GOLANG, PYTHON, MR HDFS HBASE, REDIS, MEMCACHE, MYSOL, SOLIDITY and SCRUM.

I am a big fan of mobile internet application development technology. I have a strong curiosity about the newest technology, which is the main reason why I deeply love to research new technology.
